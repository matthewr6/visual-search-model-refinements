try doing only redvs green against previous data to compare slopes

also try making sigma a little larger - larger is 17.5 and 10 instead of 15/7.5

smaller is 12.5/5

conjunctions_objresized: resized, 15/7.5
conjunctions_smallerinhibition: resized, 12.5/5
larger_inhibition: 17.5/10

redgreen is smaller + normal size (I think...)
